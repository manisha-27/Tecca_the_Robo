### [BRUTE FORCE Approch(NAIVE):](https://github.com/manisha-27/Tecca_the_Robo/blob/main/LeetCode/DSA(GFG)/Max_Min/MaxMin.cpp)

`The given algorithm can be considered a brute force approach because it simply iterates through the entire array to find the smallest and largest elements. It doesn't use any advanced data structures or algorithms to optimize the search process, and it performs a constant number of operations for each element.`

Time Complexity= O(N)

There are more efficient algorithms to find the minimum and maximum values in an array than the brute force approach used in the given code. Here are two commonly used algorithms:

### [Divide and Conquer Algorithm:]()
`This algorithm recursively divides the array into two halves until each half contains only one element. It then compares the minimum and maximum values of each half and returns the minimum and maximum values of the entire array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn).`

### [Tournament Method:]()
`In this method, we divide the array into pairs and compare the elements of each pair to find the smaller and larger values. We then repeat this process for the winners of each pair until we have only one element left, which is both the minimum and maximum value of the array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n).`

Both of these algorithms are more efficient than the brute force approach used in the given code, especially for large input sizes.
